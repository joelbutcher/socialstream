## v1.x, 2.x, and 3.x

> :warning: We no longer support v1.x, 2.x 8and 3.x, please update / upgrade to 4.x or later.

Unfortunately, due to inconsistencies in the release structure of these branches alongside 4.x, the changelog between a number of releases doesn't make sense.
Therefor, these changes have been omitted from this file.
